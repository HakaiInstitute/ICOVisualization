# ICO Data Explorer

## Project Description
The Integrated Coastal Observatory (ICO) is a network of community partners who are collecting monthly environmental-DNA (eDNA) samples in order to better understand local and coastal patterns of marine biodiversity. The ICO Data Explorer is an on-line data visualization tool that will facilitate user-driven exploration of these genetic data across space and time.

## Critical features and functionality
### Functional requirements
End users must be able to:
- See a geographical map of data sources
- Select data sources and observe data through time
- Select time-points to observe data across data sources
- Filter output to certain focal species of interest (both within and among data sources)
- Change the time-frame that is being viewed
- Output custom summary tables of the diversity present at different data sources


### Non-function requirements
End users must be able to:
- Understand how local diversity changes through time*
- Understand how diversity changes across space 
- Quantify the prevalence of target species at a particular site*
- Feel invested in the ICO project and validated for their ongoing work collecting samples*
- Feel a sense of pride in their contribution to a large-scale coastal network*

## User Stories
### Public End User

- Tagline

   Wants a better understanding of the marine diversity present at their collection site. Wants to understand how local diversity changes over time.

- Perspective and Unmet Needs

   Biodiversity surveys are costly and time-consuming. Our partners are looking for a simple method for assessing marine biodiversity. They also want to understand how genomic technology (such as eDNA) can be used for bio-monitoring, but without the need to understand anything about genomics.
  
- Key Functionalities and Visualizations
  
   These will vary at each location depending on peopleâ€™s interests, but some common goals will be to know whether certain taxa are present at their location and understand the seasonality of these patterns. 
 
   
- Acceptance Criteria
  
  An ICO partner can interpret the spatial and temporal distribution of eDNA-derived biodiversity data without any knowledge of the underlying genetic approaches. The visualization tool will further help the partner feel invested and essential to the ICO initiative.


## Data Sources and Processes

- Tables of genetic data cataloguing diversity from each sample collected by the ICO network
- Tables of metadata containing the location, timing (etc, etc) of each sample from each source

- Data can be stored in the local repository to start but should be eventually be moved into the database and accessed through the API. 

# Implementation and Code Base
Based on the https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/ReactD3TemplateRepo template.

Essential reading for converting normal D3 code to object oriented code.

## Getting started developing and intended workflow
### Intial IDE Setup and Git Flow.
I would recommend using VSCode to develop. https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Open a new terminal in VSCODE. 
- `cd "folder_name"` Navigate to your work folder,
- `git clone https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/frontpage.git` Clone the repo,
- `git checkout -b "new_branch_name"` Checkout a new branch.

Do work in VSCode, then when ready to create commits:
- `git status` Check your changes,
- `git add -A` if adding all, or `git add "file_name(s)"` Add files to staging area,
- `git commit -m "your_commit_message_here"` Create a commit once desired files are added,
- `git push` Push changes to your branch,
- Create a PR on Github so that others can review and request changes or approve.
- Merge PR and Celebrate.

### Doing work in this repo.
Once you have pulled down the repo you will have to:
- `npm install` Install the dependencies specified in package.json: 
- `npm start` Start the hot-reloading server. This will open an auto-updating development tab in chrome. Write code and save it and it will automatically show in the tab which refreshes itself on file saves.
- `npm run build` Generates a production ready version of the site that have been transpiled in /dist. Does not start a hot-reloading tab in Chrome. However! If you wish to run the production code of this repository however, you will need to change two things before running `npm run build`.
1. change the path used inside the /d3/d3Chart.js file `loadData('./src/assets/qu39_ctd.csv'`) to `loadData('./qu39_ctd.csv')` to access a copy of qu39_ctd you will manually copy into the /dist folder.
2. copy-paste a copy of qu39_ctd.csv into the /dist folder.
Now you can run a local server of the production code by running `serve` (an npm package installed during `npm install`) inside the /frontpage directory from the command line. Running this here captures all the assets in the repo.
Open the link provided by serve. I believe it is normally `http://localhost:5000`, and you should be able to select the /dist folder inside the page that opens at that link. 

## Development tools and features
This repo uses webpack, bable, React, and object oriented JavaScript to make creating and maintaining D3 visualizations simpler and more robust. In the future, the addition of TypeScript should produce a substantial improvement to tracking of data schemas and objects within data visualizations. 
There are some files in the repo which specify behaviours of these development tools.
They are:
- `.babelrc`: controls how Babel transpiles our ES6 code into vanilla js, and also packages html, js, and assets using "loaders".
- `eslintrc.js`: a VSCode environment file that enables us to have code linting that supports clean, readable, safe code.
- `.gitignore`: a file which names files and folders that git should ignore in tracking changes to the repo.
- `package.json`: a file that npn uses to a) specify command line scripts, b) install dev and production node_module dependencies. These node_modules are downloaded in `/node_modules/` and accessible anywhere in the app using `import` statements. Greatly simplifies bringing open source npm js modules (libraries) into code. You can add new npm modules to package.json by calling `npm install "node_module"` with the `--save`, `--save-dev`, `-g` flags depending on the node_module and your needs.
- `package-lock.json`: a file that `package.json` uses to track all the crazy dependencies of npm modules. This is not intended for human consumption, but is part of the repo.
- `webpack.config.js`: a file that specifies webpack's entry points, outputs, and file loaders and rules. This also enables the hot-reloading server that is so useful for web-development.
- `tscongif.json`: a file that specifies the enforcement of typings according to the TypeScript super set language that Microsoft has created. Incredibly useful in complex applications to know what those unknowable variable values are. Might adopt in future.

## Basic Architecture
The basic architecture of the app is as follows:
### src/
- `index.html`: holds the named HTML elements that React grabs to inject its rendered JSX into.
- `index.js`: imports the ReactD3Viz component for webpack to access the entire app and inject it into `index.html`.
### src/assets/
- place your data assets, images, and other stuff here for reference.
### src/components/
- `reactD3Viz.jsx`: Our root component that holds UI selection state, and provides setters for each UI selection. Renders all the react components in its `Render ()` function. Create and add components to the `ReactD3Viz` component to generate nice layouts.
- `chart.jsx`: controls the rendering of the D3 chart by using React LifeCycle methods and local state. Alternatively, you can create charts using other npm packages such as Plotly and many others and describe their behaviour in here.
### src/d3/
- `d3Chart.js`: contains the object oriented D3 code for constructing, loading data, initially drawing, and updating the chart based on control selections.
